## HOW TO CALCULATE FEDERAL INCOME TAX

### Step 1: Calculate Taxable Income
Taxable Income = Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) - Standard Deduction (or Itemized Deductions)

### Step 2: Apply Progressive Tax Brackets
Tax is calculated cumulatively through each bracket.

Example for 2025 Single Filer with $75,000 taxable income:
- First $11,925 at 10% = $1,192.50
- Next $36,550 ($48,475 - $11,925) at 12% = $4,386.00
- Next $26,525 ($75,000 - $48,475) at 22% = $5,835.50
- Total Tax = $11,414.00
- Effective Tax Rate = 15.2% (even though marginal rate is 22%)

### Step 3: Apply Credits
Subtract any tax credits from the calculated tax amount.

## IMPORTANT TAX CONCEPTS

### MARGINAL TAX RATE
The rate you pay on your last dollar of income (your highest bracket).

### EFFECTIVE TAX RATE
Your total tax divided by your total income (usually lower than marginal rate).

### PROGRESSIVE TAX SYSTEM
Higher income is taxed at higher rates, but only the portion in each bracket is taxed at that bracket's rate.

### TAXABLE INCOME vs GROSS INCOME
Taxable Income = Gross Income - Deductions (Standard or Itemized)
Only taxable income is subject to tax brackets.

### PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS
Personal exemptions were eliminated starting in 2018 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).
Personal exemption amount: $0
