================================================================================
SECTION 1: STATE INCOME TAX OVERVIEW
================================================================================

## KEY CONCEPTS:

### State Income Tax Structures (3 Types):

**1. NO INCOME TAX (8 states)**
- No state-level income tax on wages/salaries
- May still have other taxes (sales, property, etc.)

**2. FLAT RATE TAX (14 states as of 2025)**
- Single tax rate applies to all taxable income
- Simpler than graduated systems
- Rate typically 3-6%

**3. GRADUATED/PROGRESSIVE TAX (27 states + DC)**
- Multiple tax brackets like federal system
- Higher income taxed at higher rates
- Number of brackets varies (2-12 brackets)

### Important State Tax Distinctions:

**Standard Deductions:**
- Some states use federal standard deduction
- Some have their own state-specific amounts
- Some don't offer standard deductions

**Personal Exemptions:**
- Vary by state (some offer, some don't)
- Often different from federal exemptions
- May phase out at higher incomes

**Conformity to Federal Code:**
- "Conformity" = how closely state follows federal tax rules
- Some states: Current conformity (follow latest federal law)
- Some states: "Rolling" conformity (update automatically)
- Some states: Fixed date conformity (stuck on older federal law)

================================================================================

================================================================================
SECTION 6: STATE BANKING AND FINANCIAL REGULATIONS
================================================================================

## STATE BANKING OVERSIGHT:

### Dual Banking System:
- **Federal:** Banks chartered by OCC, regulated by Fed/FDIC
- **State:** Banks chartered by states, regulated by state banking departments
- **Both:** State banks can be FDIC-insured

### State Banking Departments:

Each state has a banking/financial regulation department:
- Charters state banks
- Licenses financial institutions
- Regulates state-chartered banks
- Consumer protection enforcement
- Investigates complaints

### State-Specific Banking Laws:

**Usury Laws (Interest Rate Caps):**
- Some states cap interest rates on loans
- Varies significantly by state
- Federal law allows nationally chartered banks to "export" their home state's rates

**Check Cashing/Payday Lending:**
- Heavily regulated at state level
- Some states ban payday lending
- Others allow with restrictions
- Rate caps vary dramatically

**Money Transmitter Licenses:**
- Required for money transfer services
- Each state has own requirements
- FinTech companies must obtain in each operating state

**Cryptocurrency Regulations:**
- Vary dramatically by state
- Some require BitLicense (NY) or similar
- Some have minimal regulation
- Evolving rapidly

## STATE SECURITIES REGULATIONS:

### Blue Sky Laws:
- State securities laws
- Registration requirements for securities sold in state
- Licensing for brokers/advisors operating in state
- Fraud prevention
- Investor protection

### State Securities Regulators:
- Enforce state securities laws
- Register securities offerings
- License broker-dealers and investment advisors
- Investigate fraud
- Coordinate with SEC

## CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION (State Level):

**State Laws May Cover:**
- Mortgage lending and servicing
- Credit card practices
- Debt collection
- Credit reporting
- Auto financing
- Student loan servicing
- Financial privacy

**Note:** State laws can be MORE protective than federal, but not less (generally)

================================================================================
SECTION 7: STATE-SPECIFIC FDIC INSURANCE CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

## FDIC COVERAGE IS FEDERAL - NOT STATE-SPECIFIC

### Key Points:

1. **FDIC is Federal:** $250,000 limit applies regardless of state
2. **All States:** Same FDIC rules apply in all 50 states
3. **State-Chartered Banks:** Can be FDIC-insured (most are)
4. **Credit Unions:** Insured by NCUA (National Credit Union Administration), not FDIC

### State Considerations:

**State-Chartered vs. Nationally-Chartered:**
- Both can be FDIC-insured
- Verify at fdic.gov/bankfind
- Charter type doesn't affect FDIC coverage amount

**State Banking Guaranty Funds:**
- Some states have additional insurance for state-chartered banks
- NOT a substitute for FDIC
- Rare and limited

**Credit Union Insurance:**
- Credit unions: NCUA insurance (equivalent to FDIC)
- $250,000 per depositor, per credit union
- Federal and state-chartered credit unions both covered

### State Unclaimed Property Laws:

**Dormant Accounts:**
- Each state has "escheatment" laws
- Dormant bank accounts transferred to state after period of inactivity
- Period varies by state (typically 3-5 years)
- Can reclaim through state unclaimed property office
- Not related to FDIC insurance but important to know

================================================================================
SECTION 8: STATE TAX FILING DEADLINES
================================================================================

## STANDARD DEADLINE: April 15 (Most States)

Most states mirror the federal April 15 deadline, but EXCEPTIONS exist:

### DIFFERENT STATE DEADLINES:

**April 20:**
- Hawaii

**April 30:**
- Delaware
- Iowa
- Louisiana (May 15 for 2025)

**May 1:**
- Virginia
- Oklahoma (for some filers)

### EXTENSION DEADLINES:

- Most states: October 15 (following federal)
- Some states grant automatic extensions
- Some require filing extension request

### DISASTER EXTENSIONS:

States frequently grant deadline extensions for:
- Natural disasters
- State of emergency declarations
- Federal disaster declarations

**2025 Notable Extensions:**
- Arkansas: Extended to July 31 (weather-related)
- Georgia & South Carolina: Extended to May 1 (Hurricane Helene)
- Kentucky: Extended to November 3 (flooding)

**Always verify current deadlines with state revenue department**

================================================================================
SECTION 9: RECIPROCAL TAX AGREEMENTS
================================================================================

## WHAT IS RECIPROCITY?

### STATES WITH RECIPROCAL AGREEMENTS (2025):

**Illinois** has reciprocity with:
- Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin

**West Virginia** has reciprocity with:
- Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia

**Wisconsin** has reciprocity with:
- Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan

**District of Columbia** has reciprocity with:

### IMPORTANT NOTES ON RECIPROCITY:

- Must file form with employer in work state
- Still must file resident return in home state
- May need to file non-resident return in work state to claim refund
- Does not apply to self-employment income
- Only applies to wages/salaries
- Some agreements have specific requirements/limitations

### NON-RESIDENT TAXATION (Without Reciprocity):

If no reciprocity agreement exists:
1. Pay tax to work state as non-resident
2. Pay tax to home state as resident
3. Claim credit on home state return for taxes paid to work state
4. Net result: Usually pay your home state's rate (whichever is higher)

2. Provide state tax RATE/STRUCTURE info
3. Explain that they ADD together
4. Note that state taxes are often deductible on federal return (up to $10,000 SALT cap)

**Example:**
"Your federal tax on $100,000 would be approximately $X,XXX. California has a graduated tax system with rates from 1% to 13.3%. For specific California tax calculation, please consult a tax professional or use California tax software. Your total tax burden would be federal + state combined. Note that you can deduct up to $10,000 in state taxes on your federal return (SALT deduction cap)."

## STATE BANKING QUESTIONS:

**Approach:**
1. Explain that banking is dual-regulated (federal + state)

I'm happy to help with federal tax calculations, FDIC insurance concepts, or general financial questions."
